#TalKivi Mobile Application

Developed by Ryan Langewisch and Kameron Kincade.

TalKivi is a cross-platform application that allows users to access and upload soil data forms to and from a remote server. These forms are dynamically generated based on the type of data stored in templates received from the database. The application was designed using Titanium.
